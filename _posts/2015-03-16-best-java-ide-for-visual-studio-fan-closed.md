Best Java IDE for Visual Studio fan? [closed]


As a C# programmer I want to increase the java knowledge and the only barrier is getting grip with the java IDEs like Eclipse. What can I do or use to get Visual-Studio-like experience from these IDEs.

EDIT: I don't want visual studio drag and drop support specifically but I need the Resharper plugin functionalities and responsive intellisense.

EDIT: I have tried Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntellijIdea but they feel too archaic (but with impressive features!) compared to Visual Studio. Can I make them look and behave like Visual Studio editor?


--------------------------------------- 
It would really help if you would explain what Visual Studio features you feel are missing. I only have experience of Visual Studio + R# and Eclipse, but I've always felt [Eclipse is way ahead of Visual Studio in many ways](http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2005/12/22/visual-studio-vs-eclipse). I'd go so far as to say that it's only [with ReSharper installed that Visual Studio really becomes properly usable](http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2007/03/27/visual-studio-2005-vs-eclipse-again-but-this-time-with-resharper). (Having said that, 2008 is a lot better than 2005. We've finally got a way to sort using directives and remove unused ones! Wahay! That feature's only been in Eclipse since... well, since it first came out, I suspect...)

You say you want "R#'s features and responsive Intellisense" - is Eclipse's Intellisense not working for you? I find it works extremely well! You can tweak things like how quickly it comes up in the settings page - is it possible that Visual Studio's settings are just more "aggressive" which has come over as making it more responsive?

What I _would_ say is that the visual styles are just different enough to induce cognitive dissonance - and that can often make one _feel_ "archaic" compared with the other. In my experience this can work both ways, depending on what you've been using heavily most recently.

One plus for Visual Studio: I find its debugger _much_ easier to use than Eclipse's. The Watch window is just "click and start typing" for instance. It doesn't help that I've never managed to learn the keys for Eclipse's debugger. You can tell I'm not a debugger person, really, can't you?

EDIT: There are _lots_ of [Eclipse keyboard cheat sheets](http://www.google.com/search?q=eclipse+keyboard+cheat+sheet). From the search, I like [this PDF](http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/EclipseEmacsKeybindings_3_1.pdf), [this shorter list](http://www.n0sl33p.org/dev/eclipse_keys.html), and [this list with more explanations](http://www.rossenstoyanchev.org/write/prog/eclipse/eclipse3.html).
